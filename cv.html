  <h2>Profile</h2>
  <p>From Boston, Massachusetts, US. Developed an early interest in gadgets, electronics, and computers. Started working at an early age to fund building a computer. A programming hobby turned into a job directly out of high school and was kept for ten years. Moved to Sweden in the summer of 2009, retaining the same job and becoming a full time remote employee. Moved back to the US for one year before leaving my job to travel. I’m the reverse-engineering, problem solving, figure-it-out-yourself kind with a passionate interest in gadgets, technology, world travel, and most recently, scuba diving. Certified PADI Master Scuba Diver Trainer currently working in Koh Tao, Thailand.</p>

  <h2>Work Experience</h2>

  <h3>Jungle Coders, Koh Tao, Thailand — 2016-Present</h3>
  <p>Senior Ruby on Rails developer and devops at Jungle Coders based in Koh Tao, Thailand.</p>

  <h3>Sairee Cottage Diving, Koh Tao, Thailand — 2015-Present</h3>
  <p>Worked as a PADI Master Scuba Diver Trainer at one of the premier dive shops on Koh Tao in Thailand. Took novice divers on try-dives, certified new divers, increased the training level of already-certified divers. Additionally, worked in the reception of the dive shop to welcome new customers, provide customer, service, and help people with the logistics of their diving trip.</p>

  <h3>Breuer &amp; Co., Wakefield, MA, US — 2003-2013</h3>
  <p>An information systems company based near Boston, Massachusetts with a 35 year history of delivering highly customised, secure, and robust data warehousing systems. The company’s core markets today are in school information systems, healthcare, and accounting systems. During my time there the company grew from roughly ten to 50 employees and maintained its tight-knit community feel between all employees, including management.</p>

  <p>Started as a spring internship position and became a full time position after a month. Primary responsibility since the beginning was the development of hosted data systems. Secondary responsibility for many years was as network co-administrator and IT support for the company’s Windows environment, network infrastructure, and phone system. Created and maintained dozens of desktop and web applications using VB, ASP, PHP, C#, ASP.NET Forms, ASP.NET MVC, Ruby on Rails, and all with heavy use of Microsoft SQL Server on the backend. Applications and modules were required to be generic but highly customisable to suit the needs of as many of our 120 clients as possible. On such example was creating a credit card and bank transfer payment system that could support eight different payment providers across the world, multiple currencies, configurable payment options, and a configurable look and feel. Operating hosted data systems demands strict attention to performance and security. Setting-up new clients on the hosted data system platform requires extensive data migration with reverse engineering of current data systems. Most implementations I did involved an on-site visit to assist in client training and helping them understand the data migration.</p>
