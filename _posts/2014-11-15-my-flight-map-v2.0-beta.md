The 2.0 beta version of [My Flight Map](http://www.myflightmap.com) is currently open for beta testing at [kaya.mroach.com](http://kaya.mroach.com). This is a full rewrite using Rails 4.1. With the new platform it will be easier to maintain and add features. The UI is the last bit needing some attention.

Version 2.0 is open source and hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/mroach/myflightmap](https://github.com/mroach/myflightmap). All are welcome to submit issues for feature requests and bug reports.

More to come when we're live.
